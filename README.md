**Transfer Hub - File Sharing System**
Transfer Hub is a modern, scalable, and easy-to-use file-sharing platform that allows users to securely upload, manage, and share files with others. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), this application provides a seamless and efficient experience for transferring files over the web.

**Features:**
User Authentication: Secure sign-up and login functionality with JWT-based authentication.

File Upload: Easily upload files of various types and sizes with progress indicators.

File Sharing: Share files via secure download links that can be sent to others.

File Management: Organize and manage your uploaded files with a simple user interface.

Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a smooth user experience across platforms.

Tech Stack:**
**MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing user data and file metadata.

Express.js: A flexible Node.js web application framework that handles API routes and server-side logic.

React: A front-end JavaScript library for building dynamic, interactive user interfaces.

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building fast and scalable server-side applications.

**How It Works:**
Frontend (React): The user interacts with the application through a responsive, React-based frontend. It includes features like file uploads, user login, and a clean interface for managing shared files.

Backend (Node.js & Express): The backend is built with Node.js and Express, providing RESTful API endpoints for file uploads, user authentication, and file retrieval.

Database (MongoDB): MongoDB stores file metadata (such as file name, size, and owner) and user credentials for secure authentication.

File Storage: Files are stored securely and can be accessed or shared using a unique download URL.

**Future Improvements:**
Real-time File Sharing: Implement real-time notifications for when a file is uploaded or shared.

File Encryption: Add end-to-end encryption for more secure file sharing.

Multi-file Upload: Support for uploading multiple files at once.

Cloud Storage Integration: Integrate with services like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for better file handling.
